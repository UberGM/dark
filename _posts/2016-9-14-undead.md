Damn. Long time no see.

So it's been a while. I'm not at all who I used to be. I'm still into web dev and plan to start making jekyll themes again, but
I stopped doing actual coding. Now I'm 13, I play Super Smash Bros Melee competitively, started learning the guitar recently, and so
much more. I'm not really a nerd anymore I just like a couple nerdy things. Life is different now but I like this website. I'll
post random shit.

Sites will be fixed today, but projects is dead for the time being because that's the "freehosting effect" website with stuff on it?
DEAD!
